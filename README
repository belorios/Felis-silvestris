***       Installation instructions        ***
**********************************************

Unpack and upload the files to the place you want to run the application from.
When all files are uploaded check so that the application has write permissions on /Src/config, /src/rss
and on /libs/htmlpurifier/library/HTMLPurifier/DefinitionCache and on /libs/htmlpurifier/library/HTMLPurifier/DefinitionCache/Serializer.

Navigate with your favorite browser to the path where you placed your installation and 
add /install to the end of the path. 

Set your desired text for the applicaiton name, footer and payoff and then set the settings 
for your databaseconnection. In this step you are also prompted to give information for the 
admintrator for your application, dont forget these settings because the password cannot be 
restored for this user.
	
When all fields is set click on the install button, on the next page it tries to build your config 
file and lets you choose if you want to install the application with some dummy data. 

When the installation is done, set as restrictive permissions on the config folder in /Src and remove
the /install directory. 


Congratulations, your application is now ready for use!

# Some parts of the code is badly commented in swedish, working on translate all to english

# The language support is not implemented in all modules yet and the only complete language right now is english.

# The forums autosave function does not fully work with all editors that is available for use. 

	Plain and markitup
	Everything works flawless

	Tinymce and wymEditor
	It doesnt initiat the autosave when you are writing in the editor, it will only initiate when you are writing the title. 

	NicEdit
	It doesnt work from start, you need to press the button "save draft" before it will work, after the first manual save it will work by itself tho.
